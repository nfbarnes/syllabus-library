##### Course Prerequisites: To enroll in this course, you must have earned a grade of C (2.0) or better in ENC 1101 and ENC 1102. Failure to meet the prerequisites for a course can result in failing the course.

##### Textbook: There are no required textbooks for this course. All materials will be accessible online and made available through Webcourses.

##### Course Description: This course will focus on the basics of nonfiction magazine feature writing, including leads, structure, purpose, voice, language, research, and audience analysis. The course introduces students to best practices in writing for online and print publications while improving transferable writing skills and gathering industry insights. As students develop feature articles on such topics as film and music, sports and recreation, food and travel, they examine what it means for writers to be culture-makers while also observing, documenting, and reflecting upon the human impulse to create and share experience. The final project will consist of students collaborating to create an issue of their own web-based magazine.

##### Course Objectives:
Read and analyze published magazine articles to explore the magazine industry and learn techniques from active writers/editors
Demonstrate proficiency and versatility in magazine writing skills: gathering and researching material, focusing an idea, developing a rhetorical stance
Demonstrate the principles and techniques of making stylistic choices for specific audiences and purposes
Become effective communicators through readings, discussions, and writing projects
Develop confidence and control as a writer
Develop collaborative skills toward the development of a major, editorial project 
Mode of Course: You have registered for a web-based version of ENC 3310. We will not have any synchronous class meeting times. This means that you will complete your coursework throughout the week at your own pace. There will still be strict deadlines to meet. Expect to have assignments due every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of the semester. During the group project phase, you may be expected to arrange for synchronous meetings with your fellow group members. Each group will organize its own meeting schedule.

##### Tech Requirements & Expectations: 
You will need to have access to a computer and the Internet frequently in this course. Students will also need to use Microsoft Word in order to submit acceptable written assignments. See our Webcourse for instructions regarding how to download Microsoft Word, available to all UCF students. If you do not own a computer, there are computers accessible to you in all of UCF’s student computer labs. For further information on computer labs, please see: http://guides.ucf.edu/c.php?g=78577&p=517810Links to an external site..

##### Academic Activity Assignment: 
All faculty are required to document students’ academic activity at the beginning of each course. In order to document that you began this course, please complete the Academic Activity assignment by the end of the first week of classes or as soon as possible after adding the course, but no later than the first Friday of the semester by 5pm. Failure to do so may result in a delay in the disbursement of your financial aid.

##### Communication: 
If you need to contact me, send me an email or message via the Webcourses Inbox. In your email, include your name, the class you’re taking, and a clear description of your question or concern. Be professional and polite. If your message is rude or otherwise doesn’t follow these guidelines, I may not reply to it. Timely communication is important. You can expect to receive a response from me within 24 hours M-TH, 48 hours on weekends. Emails received after 5pm on weekdays will not receive responses until the following workday. 

Three-Before-Me: In order to facilitate effective communication, it's best to follow the Three-Before-Me rule. Before you send the email with your question, stop and make sure you have consulted three sources before you send that message. Most questions that students have about assignments or the course have already been answered in the syllabus or elsewhere on Webcourses. When you check at least three sources you are likely to find the answer to your question much more quickly than if you jump straight to an email. If you don't find the answer after checking three course resources first (it will probably take five minutes or less), then an email or Inbox message is the best next step. 

Of course, I welcome students asking questions and/or making an appointment for office hours. (It's always better to ask than assume!) The Three-Before-Me rule helps all of us make the best use of valuable time. 

Here is a list of sources you can consult before sending the email: Syllabus, pages in the Course Details modules, weekly announcements, detailed assignment pages, Webcourses@UCF Support, etc.

Final Magazine Project
Attendance/Participation: This is an online class—your online attendance and participation are vital to the success of the class. In order to keep on track, you must log into Webcourses daily and carefully follow along with the schedule of assignments, announcements, and other course information. Engage in assigned discussions with energy and insight. You will also be expected to serve as an active and respectful participant in all activities and discussions as well as being an active, contributing member of your final group project team. Please take the time to familiarize yourself with Webcourses before the semester begins. Check your email regularly and ensure that you have enabled Webcourse notifications so that you don't miss any important information or updates.

Classroom/Online Behavior: Proper classroom behavior is expected at all times even though this is an online class. Students must follow UCF standards for personal and academic conduct as outlined in The Golden Rule. As a matter of common courtesy, please complete all assignments/discussions/course activities on time, demonstrating preparation and engagement for the full activity. Do not engage in conversation other than the classroom critical discussions we will be having about the texts on hand. Proper classroom conduct also entails creating a positive learning experience for all students, regardless of sex, race, religion, sexual orientation, social class, or any other feature of personal identification; therefore, sexist, racist, prejudicial, homophobic, or other derogatory remarks will not be tolerated. This includes the content of work created and submitted in this class. Together, we will work to create a productive and encouraging writing and learning community. As such, we will treat all people with dignity and respect while conducting ourselves with professionalism.

Guidelines for Online Interactions: Many of the "rules of the road" that apply to conversations also apply to the use of interactive tools used in this course. Use the following conventions when interacting with the instructor and fellow students:

While using synchronous tools, such as chat and conferences, be located in a quiet, private environment. This will help you stay clear of disturbances.
If you want to send a personal message to the instructor or to another student, use conversations rather than the Discussions (see Inbox).
Be patient. Don’t expect an immediate response when you post to a discussion.
Respect each other’s ideas, feelings, and experience.
Be courteous and considerate. It is important to be honest and to express yourself freely, but being considerate of others is just as important and expected online, as it is in the classroom.
Explore disagreements and support assertions with data and evidence.
Be sure to post discussions in the appropriate Discussion topic.
Do not use postings such as "I agree," "I don’t know either," "Who cares," or "ditto." They do not add to the discussion, take up space on the Discussions, and will not be counted for assignment credit.
Avoid posting large blocks of text. If you must, break them into paragraphs and use a space between paragraphs.
During a Discussion assignment, deadlines for posting to and replying will be specified with each assignment. It is a good practice to always check the Discussions tool multiple times during the week.
Missed Work/Late Assignments: Hand your work in on time. I do not accept late assignments except in cases of documented medical emergencies. As a rule, I do not allow make-up assignments. If you’re having trouble with the workload, come to my office hours and we can talk about it.

My late work policy differs based on the assignment type. I do not accept late work for minor assignments such as discussion posts. Late or missing low stakes assignments will receive a zero. 

For major assignments such as Articles, I will accept late submissions for reduced credit up to one week past the due date. The grade will be lowered five points for each day (including weekends) that the assignment is not turned in on time. After one week from the original due date, the assignment will receive a zero.

Please note that my late work assignment policy for major projects DOES NOT apply to the Final Project. Because Final Projects are due during the final exam week and course grades must be submitted in a timely manner, late submissions of portfolios will not be accepted.

Neither technological issues nor being busy with work for other classes are valid excuses for missing or late work. Plan ahead and save your work frequently, back up your files on flash drives or a cloud service (there are plenty of free options), save assignments before submitting, and double-check to make sure that all submissions go through.

Because this is a Gordon Rule class, all major assignments (Articles 1, 2, 3 and Final Project) must be submitted by the final exam in order to fulfill the Gordon Rule requirements of this course. Please note: even if you miss the deadline for a graded assignment, you must still submit a draft of this assignment to pass this Gordon Rule class. If you do not submit a final draft of each major assignment by the final exam period, you will automatically fail the class.

Special Considerations: If, for any reason, you have a family emergency, significant illness, or any unforeseen happenings during this course, contact me immediately. Emergencies happen, so I will reserve the right to consider appropriate adjustments context and on a case-by-case basis. Work for other classes or activities are not valid excuses for missing work. You must plan ahead. Whenever possible, get ahead of the situation and notify me ASAP so that alternative arrangements may be made. If you do not contact me, the usual late work policies will apply.

Assignment Submission: All assignments must be submitted digitally using our Webcourses Assignments tool. Do not submit assignments through email. Make sure you see the green checkmark and the “Assignment Submitted” date and time confirmation before closing the window. Assignments must be submitted as .doc or .docx files. Google Docs, Pages, or any submissions other than Microsoft Word will not be accepted. 

Plagiarism: Don’t do it. In this class, you may only present new, original work. As writers, trust, originality, and credibility are essential to the work we are doing. We will be committed to the responsible and ethical exchange of ideas and experience. You must provide appropriate attribution for any research or idea you incorporate into your articles, projects, posts, and responses in this class. Plagiarism isn’t limited to stealing someone else’s work and passing it off as your own—if you present work as true that you know to be false, you are also in violation of the academic honesty policy. Further, all work submitted for this class must be new and original, meaning that submissions must be written exclusively for this course (not used in any other class). I will assume for this course that you will adhere to the academic creed of this University and will maintain the highest standards of academic integrity. In other words, do not cheat by giving answers to others or by taking them from anyone else. If you are caught plagiarizing, you will fail the course, and your infraction will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct. I will also adhere to the highest standards of academic integrity, so please do not expect me to change your grade illegitimately or to bend or break rules for one person that will not apply to everyone.

Turnitin: In this course we may utilize turnitin.com, an automated system which instructors can use to quickly and easily compare each student’s assignment with billions of web sites, as well as an enormous database of student papers that grows with each submission. Accordingly, you may be expected to submit assignments in electronic format. After the assignment is processed, as an instructor I receive a report from turnitin.com that states if and how another author’s work was used in the assignment. For a more detailed look at this process, visit http://www.turnitin.com (Links to an external site.).

University Writing Center: The University Writing Center (UWC), located in Trevor Colbourn Hall, offers writing support to students from first-year to graduate in every discipline. Peer writing consultants provide help at every stage of the writing process, including understanding assignments, researching, drafting, revising, incorporating sources, and learning to proofread and edit. The UWC’s purpose is not merely to fix or edit papers, but to teach writing strategies that can be applied to any writing situation. Consultations are available for individuals and small groups. You may schedule a 45-minute appointment by clicking the Success Resources tab on Webcourses, calling the UWC at 407-823-2197, or through the UWC website: http://uwc.cah.ucf.edu/Links to an external site.

#### Writing Requirements:
Reading & Lecture Discussions via Canvas (200 words each + replies to classmates)

Typically, a prompt will direct you to focus on a particular aspect of writing to discuss. Your posts and response should be substantive. This means not settling for "I like..." This means moving the conversation forward, expanding discussion, making connections, and thinking together.
